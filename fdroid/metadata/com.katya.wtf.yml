**Katya ® 👽 aims to be built on the foundations of privacy, branding, and user experience!** 
In an effort to pull others away from proprietary chat platforms to the Katya ® 👽 AI 🧠 REChain ®️ 🪐 Blockchain Node Network protocol.

Katya ® 👽 AI 🧠 REChain ®️ 🪐 Blockchain Node Network with Matrix Protocol has the potential to be a standardized peer-to-peer chat protocol, [and in a way already is,](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix) that allows people to communicate and control their conversation data. Email has been standardized in this way for a long time. For example, someone using Outlook can still email someone using Gmail. Most popular proprietary chat platforms do not adhere to a federated or decentralized protocol, and as a result have too much control over users data.

If the goal for the Katya ® 👽 AI 🧠 REChain ®️ 🪐 Blockchain Node Network is adoption, a network effect is required for this paradigm shift. Katya ® 👽 makes the bet that the best way to attract new users is through strong branding and user experience. I hope that contributing and maintaining Katya ® 👽 will help kick start this process and help those in need. 

Katya ® 👽 will always be a not for profit, community driven application.
