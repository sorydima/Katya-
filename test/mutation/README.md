# Mutation Testing

This directory contains mutation testing configurations and reports for the Katya project.

## What is Mutation Testing?

Mutation testing is a technique to evaluate the quality of your tests by introducing small changes (mutations) to your code and checking if your tests catch these changes.

## Tools

- [Mutator](https://pub.dev/packages/mutator) for Dart/Flutter projects
- [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io/) for JavaScript/TypeScript projects (if applicable)

## How to Run Mutation Tests

1. Install the mutation testing tool.
2. Run the mutation tests using the provided scripts or commands.
3. Review the mutation score and reports.
4. Improve tests to catch undetected mutations.

## Current Status

- Mutation testing is planned for future implementation.
- No mutation tests currently configured.
