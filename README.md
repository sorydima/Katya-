### Our Mission:
Katya¬Æ aims to be built on the foundations of privacy, branding, and user experience! We strive to pull users away from proprietary chat platforms towards the Katya¬Æ AI üß† REChain¬ÆÔ∏è Blockchain Node Network protocol.

### The Katya¬Æ Vision:
Katya¬Æ AI üß† REChain¬ÆÔ∏è Blockchain Node Network with Matrix Protocol has the potential to be a standardized peer-to-peer chat protocol, allowing people to communicate and control their conversation data. Unlike most proprietary chat platforms, Katya¬Æ adheres to a federated and decentralized protocol, preventing excessive control over user data.

### Driving Adoption:
For the Katya¬Æ AI üß† REChain¬ÆÔ∏è Blockchain Node Network to succeed, a network effect is essential. Katya¬Æ bets on strong branding and exceptional user experience to attract new users. Contributing to and maintaining Katya¬Æ will help kick-start this process and support those in need.

### Community-Driven and Non-Profit:
Katya¬Æ will always be a not-for-profit, community-driven application. Join us in this mission to redefine digital communication and create a future where user privacy and control are paramount.

## ‚ú® Features
- No analytics.
- No proprietary third party services.
    - iOS will have APNS support, but will be made clear to the user.
- All data is AES-256 encrypted at rest.
- E2EE for direct chats using [Olm/Megolm](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm) .
- All indicators of presence are opt-in only (typing indicators, read receipts, etc).
- Customize themes and colors throughout the app.

## üöÄ Goals
- [x] Desktop clients meet parity with mobile.
- [x] Screen lock and pin protected cache features.
- [ ] P2P messaging through a locally run server on the client.
- [ ] Allow transfering user data from one homeserver to another, or from local to remote servers.
- [ ] CLI client using ncurses and the same redux store contained here (common).

## üèóÔ∏è Building
You may notice Katya ¬Æ üëΩ does not look very dart-y (for example, no \_private variable declarations, or using redux instead of provider) in an effort to reduce the learning curve from other languages or platforms.

### Workstation
- Workstation independent setup for Katya ¬Æ üëΩ development:
    - Install Flutter (stable channel for all platforms);
    - Install necessary third party SDKs and tooling:
        - iOS -> XCode;
        - Android -> Android Studio;
    - Install CMake from CLI through Android Studio Platform Tools (for OLM/megOLM);
    - Install libs needed for CMake:
        - Mac OS -> ```brew install ninja```;
        - Linux -> ```sudo apt install ninja-build```;
        - Windows -> ```choco install ninja```;
    - Clone repo and init submodules:
        - ```git submodule update --init --recursive```;
    - Run the following prebuild commands:
        - ```flutter pub get```;
        - ```flutter pub run build_runner build```;

### iOS/Android
0. Install Android Studio;
0. Install latest Commandline Tools through Android Studio GUI;
0. Confirm `sdkmanager` is available in your path;
0. Pull the latest CMake, NDK, and other dependencies;
0. Pull dependencies needed:
  - ```flutter pub get```;
1. Generate JSON conversion for models:
  - ```flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs```;
2. Generate JSON conversion for models:
  - ```flutter run```.

### Mac OS  
1. ```flutter config --enable-macos-desktop```;
2. ```brew install libolm``` to install native OLM dependencies;
3. Copy the dylib - not the soft links - to the macos folder:
  - `cp /opt/homebrew/Cellar/libolm/libolm.3.x.x.dylib ./macos/libolm.3.x.x.dylib`;
3. Follow instructions for linking the dylib generated from brew to the Katya ¬Æ üëΩ project:
  - Refer to [Mac OS dylib linking guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/c-interop#compiled-dynamic-library-macos);
4. ```flutter build macos``` to build the .app bundle.

### Linux
1. ```flutter config --enable-linux-desktop```;
2. ```apt install libolm3 libsqlite3-dev``` or ```pacman -S libolm``` or platform equivalent for libolm;
3. ```flutter build linux && flutter build bundle```;
4. Navigate to release at ```${Katya ¬Æ üëΩ_ROOT}/build/linux/release/bundle```;
5. Confirm build works with running ```${Katya ¬Æ üëΩ_ROOT}/build/linux/release/bundle/katya```.

### Windows
1. ```flutter doctor``` should give you warnings for anything missing;
2. ```flutter config --enable-windows-desktop```;
3. Compile OLM & move `olm.dll` to `libolm.dll` in the executable directory;
4. Fetch SQLite's **Precompiled Binaries for Windows** dll [from the website](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).

## üìê Architecture

### Store
- Views (Flutter + MVVM);
- State Management (redux);
- Cache (redux_persist + json_serializable + [sembast](https://pub.dev/packages/sembast) + [codec cipher](https://github.com/tekartik/sembast.dart/blob/master/sembast/doc/codec.md));
- Storage ([drift](https://pub.dev/packages/drift) + sqflite + sqlcipher).

### Integrations
- Notifications:
  - Utitlizes [android_alarm_manager](https://pub.dev/packages?q=background_alarm_manager) on Android to run the sync requests in a background thread and display notifications with [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications);
  - No third party notification provider will ever be used outside Apple's APN'S for iOS only.
- Equatable:
  - This library allows comparisons of objects within Flutter to tell if they have changed.
- JsonSerializable:
  - Unfortunately, JSON is not integrated directly in Dart/Flutter for your own objects. Code generation is required, for now, and will convert Katya ¬Æ üëΩ's custom objects to a 'Map' of respective JSON fields.
- Freezed (future):
  - Because every object in Katya ¬Æ üëΩ is immutable, freezed will help create objects doing the same thing all the 'copyWith' helper functions do today, with the improvement of allowing 'null' values to overwrite non-null values.
