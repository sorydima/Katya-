# Request for Comments (RFC)

This directory contains Request for Comments (RFC) documents for proposing, discussing, and documenting significant changes to the Katya project.

## Overview

RFCs are documents that propose and describe significant changes to the Katya project. They provide a structured way to:

- Propose new features and architectural changes
- Document design decisions and their rationale
- Gather community feedback and consensus
- Maintain a historical record of project evolution
- Ensure transparency in decision-making processes

- **Write the RFC**: Document the proposal following the template
- **Gather Feedback**: Share with stakeholders for initial feedback

### 2. RFC Review
- **Community Discussion**: Open discussion period (typically 2 weeks)
- **Technical Review**: Assessment by technical experts
- **Stakeholder Input**: Feedback from product, design, and business teams
- **Revision**: Incorporate feedback and revise the proposal

### 3. RFC Decision
- **Consensus Building**: Work towards agreement among stakeholders
