The practice of making software usable by people with disabilities. Katya implements accessibility features including screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and high contrast themes.

### Android
A mobile operating system developed by Google. Katya supports Android devices running API level 21 and above.

## B

### Bridge
A component that connects Matrix to other communication platforms (e.g., Discord, IRC, email). Katya supports various bridges for cross-platform messaging.

### BLoC (Business Logic Component)
A state management pattern used in Flutter applications. Katya uses BLoC for managing application state and business logic.

## C

### CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
Automated processes for building, testing, and deploying software. Katya uses GitHub Actions for comprehensive CI/CD pipelines.

### CodeQL
A semantic code analysis engine developed by GitHub. Katya uses CodeQL for advanced security scanning and vulnerability detection.

### Containerization
The process of packaging software with its dependencies. Katya supports Docker containerization for consistent deployment.

## D

### Decentralized
A system where control is distributed across multiple nodes rather than centralized. Katya is decentralized through the Matrix protocol.

### Device Verification
The process of confirming the identity of devices in an end-to-end encrypted conversation. Katya supports device verification for enhanced security.

## E

### End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)
A security method where only the communicating users can read the messages. Katya uses OLM and MegOLM for E2EE.

### Event
A message or state change in Matrix. Events are the basic unit of communication in the Matrix protocol.

## F

### Federated
A system where multiple independent servers can communicate. Matrix is a federated protocol, allowing users on different homeservers to communicate.

### Flutter
An open-source UI toolkit developed by Google for building natively compiled applications. Katya is built using Flutter.

## G

### GitHub Actions
A CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub. Katya uses GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment.

### Golden Tests
A type of test that compares UI output against reference images. Katya uses golden tests for UI consistency verification.

## H

### Homeserver
A server that implements the Matrix protocol. Users register on homeservers to use Matrix-based applications like Katya.

### Hot Reload
A feature in Flutter that allows developers to see changes instantly without restarting the app. Katya development benefits from Flutter's hot reload.

## I

### Integration Tests
Tests that verify the interaction between different parts of the application. Katya includes comprehensive integration tests.

### Internationalization (i18n)
The process of designing software to support multiple languages and regions. Katya supports internationalization through Flutter's i18n framework.

## J

### JSON
JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data interchange format. Matrix uses JSON for event serialization.

## K

### Key Verification
The process of verifying encryption keys between devices. Katya implements key verification for secure communication.

## L

### Localization (l10n)
The process of adapting software for specific locales. Katya supports localization for multiple languages.

### Logging
The process of recording application events and errors. Katya includes comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.

## M

### Matrix
An open standard for decentralized, real-time communication. Katya is built on the Matrix protocol.

### MegOLM
A cryptographic ratchet used for group encryption in Matrix. Katya uses MegOLM for secure group messaging.

## O

### OLM
An implementation of the Double Ratchet algorithm for end-to-end encryption. Katya uses OLM for one-to-one encryption.

### Open Source
Software with source code available to the public. Katya is open source and welcomes community contributions.

## P

### Performance Monitoring
The process of tracking application performance metrics. Katya includes performance monitoring in CI/CD pipelines.

### Privacy
The right to keep personal information confidential. Katya prioritizes user privacy with end-to-end encryption.

## Q

### QR Code
A two-dimensional barcode. Katya uses QR codes for easy device verification and contact sharing.

## R

### Room
A conversation space in Matrix. Rooms can be public or private and support various types of communication.

### Redux
A predictable state container for JavaScript applications. Katya uses Redux for complex state management.

## S

### Security Audit
A systematic evaluation of security controls. Katya undergoes regular security audits.

### State Management
The process of managing application state. Katya uses multiple state management solutions including BLoC and Redux.

### Static Analysis
The analysis of code without executing it. Katya uses tools like Flutter Analyze for static analysis.

## T

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
A software development process where tests are written before code. Katya encourages TDD practices.

### Third-Party Libraries
External code dependencies. Katya carefully manages third-party libraries for security and licensing compliance.

## U

### Unit Tests
Tests that verify individual units of code. Katya has extensive unit test coverage.

### User Experience (UX)
The overall experience of a user interacting with an application. Katya focuses on intuitive UX design.

## V

### Verification
The process of confirming the authenticity of devices or users. Katya supports multiple verification methods.

### Version Control
The management of changes to code over time. Katya uses Git for version control.

## W

### Widget
A basic building block of Flutter UI. Katya is composed of various custom and built-in widgets.

### Widget Tests
Tests that verify the behavior of Flutter widgets. Katya includes comprehensive widget testing.

## X

### XML
Extensible Markup Language. Used in various configuration files in the Katya project.

## Y

### YAML
A human-readable data serialization standard. Used for configuration files like pubspec.yaml and CI/CD workflows.

## Z

### Zero-Knowledge
A system where one party can prove knowledge of a value without revealing it. Katya implements zero-knowledge principles in encryption.
