# 001. Flutter Framework Choice

Date: 2024-01-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Katya is a cross-platform AI multifunctional social blockchain platform that needs to run on multiple platforms including iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux. The choice of framework significantly impacts development speed, code maintainability, performance, and user experience.

Key requirements:
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Native performance
- Rich UI capabilities
- Strong community support
- Good documentation
- Future-proof technology

## Decision

We have chosen Flutter as the primary framework for Katya development.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Single Codebase**: One codebase for all platforms reduces maintenance overhead
- **Native Performance**: Flutter apps compile to native code, providing excellent performance
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive widget library and third-party packages
- **Hot Reload**: Fast development cycle with instant UI updates
- **Google Support**: Backed by Google with long-term commitment
- **Growing Community**: Large and active developer community

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Dart language and Flutter concepts require learning
- **App Size**: Flutter apps tend to be larger than native apps
- **Platform-Specific Features**: Some platform-specific features may require additional work
- **Web Performance**: Web version may have performance limitations compared to native web apps

## Alternatives Considered

### React Native
- **Pros**: JavaScript ecosystem, large community, mature platform
- **Cons**: Performance issues, dependency on native modules, bridge communication overhead
- **Reason for Rejection**: Performance concerns and JavaScript fatigue

### Native Development
- **Pros**: Best performance, full platform access, mature tooling
- **Cons**: Separate codebases for each platform, higher development costs
- **Reason for Rejection**: Resource intensive and slower development

### Xamarin
- **Pros**: C# ecosystem, Microsoft's backing
- **Cons**: Smaller community, licensing concerns
- **Reason for Rejection**: Limited adoption and ecosystem size
