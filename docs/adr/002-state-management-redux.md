# 002. Redux for State Management

Date: 2024-01-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Katya is a complex application with multiple features including chat, blockchain integration, AI functionality, and cross-platform support. The application state needs to be managed efficiently across different screens, features, and platforms.

Key requirements:
- Predictable state management
- Easy debugging and testing
- Time-travel debugging capabilities
- Scalable architecture
- Good developer experience
- Performance optimization

## Decision

We have chosen Redux as the state management solution for Katya, using the flutter_redux package.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Predictable State**: Single source of truth with immutable state
- **Time-Travel Debugging**: Ability to replay actions and inspect state changes
- **Middleware Support**: Extensible with middleware for logging, async operations
- **DevTools Integration**: Rich debugging tools and state inspection
- **Testability**: Pure functions make testing straightforward
- **Performance**: Efficient change detection and selective re-renders

### Negative
- **Boilerplate Code**: Requires more boilerplate compared to simpler solutions
- **Learning Curve**: Redux concepts (actions, reducers, middleware) need understanding
- **Setup Complexity**: Initial setup requires more configuration
- **Verbosity**: More code needed for simple state changes

## Alternatives Considered

### Provider
- **Pros**: Simple, built-in Flutter solution, less boilerplate
- **Cons**: Less predictable, harder to debug complex state flows
- **Reason for Rejection**: Not suitable for complex state management needs

### Bloc Pattern
- **Pros**: Good for reactive programming, event-driven architecture
- **Cons**: More complex for simple state changes, steeper learning curve
- **Reason for Rejection**: Overkill for our current needs, better suited for specific use cases

### Riverpod
- **Pros**: Modern, compile-time safe, good performance
- **Cons**: Relatively new, smaller community, less mature ecosystem
- **Reason for Rejection**: Preferred established solutions for production stability

### GetX
- **Pros**: Simple, fast, less boilerplate
- **Cons**: Less predictable, magic behavior, harder to test
- **Reason for Rejection**: Not suitable for complex, predictable state management
