- [ ] CLI client using ncurses and the same redux store contained here (common).

## 🏗️ Building
You may notice Katya ® 👽 does not look very dart-y (for example, no \_private variable declarations, or using redux instead of provider) in an effort to reduce the learning curve from other languages or platforms.

### Workstation
- Workstation independent setup for Katya ® 👽 development:
    - Install Flutter (stable channel for all platforms);
    - Install necessary third party SDKs and tooling:
        - iOS -> XCode;
        - Android -> Android Studio;
    - Install CMake from CLI through Android Studio Platform Tools (for OLM/megOLM);
    - Install libs needed for CMake:
        - Mac OS -> ```brew install ninja```;
        - Linux -> ```sudo apt install ninja-build```;
        - Windows -> ```choco install ninja```;
    - Clone repo and init submodules:
        - ```git submodule update --init --recursive```;
    - Run the following prebuild commands:
        - ```flutter pub get```;
        - ```flutter pub run build_runner build```;

### iOS/Android
0. Install Android Studio;
0. Install latest Commandline Tools through Android Studio GUI;
0. Confirm `sdkmanager` is available in your path;
0. Pull the latest CMake, NDK, and other dependencies;
0. Pull dependencies needed:
  - ```flutter pub get```;
1. Generate JSON conversion for models:
  - ```flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs```;
2. Generate JSON conversion for models:
  - ```flutter run```.

### Mac OS  
1. ```flutter config --enable-macos-desktop```;
2. ```brew install libolm``` to install native OLM dependencies;
3. Copy the dylib - not the soft links - to the macos folder:
  - `cp /opt/homebrew/Cellar/libolm/libolm.3.x.x.dylib ./macos/libolm.3.x.x.dylib`;
3. Follow instructions for linking the dylib generated from brew to the Katya ® 👽 project:
  - Refer to [Mac OS dylib linking guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/c-interop#compiled-dynamic-library-macos);
4. ```flutter build macos``` to build the .app bundle.

### Linux
1. ```flutter config --enable-linux-desktop```;
2. ```apt install libolm3 libsqlite3-dev``` or ```pacman -S libolm``` or platform equivalent for libolm;
3. ```flutter build linux && flutter build bundle```;
4. Navigate to release at ```${Katya ® 👽_ROOT}/build/linux/release/bundle```;
5. Confirm build works with running ```${Katya ® 👽_ROOT}/build/linux/release/bundle/katya```.

### Windows
1. ```flutter doctor``` should give you warnings for anything missing;
2. ```flutter config --enable-windows-desktop```;
3. Compile OLM & move `olm.dll` to `libolm.dll` in the executable directory;
4. Fetch SQLite's **Precompiled Binaries for Windows** dll [from the website](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).

## 📐 Architecture

### Store
- Views (Flutter + MVVM);
- State Management (redux);
- Cache (redux_persist + json_serializable + [sembast](https://pub.dev/packages/sembast) + [codec cipher](https://github.com/tekartik/sembast.dart/blob/master/sembast/doc/codec.md));
- Storage ([drift](https://pub.dev/packages/drift) + sqflite + sqlcipher).

### Integrations
- Notifications:
  - Utitlizes [android_alarm_manager](https://pub.dev/packages?q=background_alarm_manager) on Android to run the sync requests in a background thread and display notifications with [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications);
  - No third party notification provider will ever be used outside Apple's APN'S for iOS only.
- Equatable:
  - This library allows comparisons of objects within Flutter to tell if they have changed.
- JsonSerializable:
  - Unfortunately, JSON is not integrated directly in Dart/Flutter for your own objects. Code generation is required, for now, and will convert Katya ® 👽's custom objects to a 'Map' of respective JSON fields.
- Freezed (future):
  - Because every object in Katya ® 👽 is immutable, freezed will help create objects doing the same thing all the 'copyWith' helper functions do today, with the improvement of allowing 'null' values to overwrite non-null values.
