## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version 3.10.0 or later)
- Dart SDK (version 3.0.0 or later)
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Git for version control
- CMake and Ninja for native builds
- Access to Matrix homeserver for testing

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/katya.git
cd katya
git submodule update --init --recursive
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

## Development Environment Setup

### IDE Configuration

- Use VS Code or Android Studio with Flutter and Dart plugins installed.
- Recommended VS Code extensions:
  - Flutter
  - Dart
  - GitLens
  - Bracket Pair Colorizer
  - Pubspec Assist

### Environment Variables

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your local environment variables.

### Running the App

```bash
flutter run
```

- Use `flutter run -d <device_id>` to target specific devices.

## Project Structure

- `lib/`: Main application source code
- `test/`: Unit, widget, and integration tests
- `android/`, `ios/`, `linux/`, `macos/`, `windows/`: Platform-specific code
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for build, test, deploy
- `examples/`: Sample implementations and usage examples
- `docs/`: Documentation files

## Coding Standards

- Follow Dart style guide: https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style
- Use `flutter format` to format code before commits
- Write clear, concise comments and documentation
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid large functions; break into smaller reusable components

## State Management

- Use Redux for global state management
- Use BLoC pattern for business logic separation
- Use `redux_persist` for state persistence
- Follow unidirectional data flow principles

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Write widget tests for UI components
- Write integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
- Use `flutter test` to run tests
- Aim for high test coverage and maintainability

## Debugging

- Use Flutter DevTools for performance and widget inspection
- Use logging for tracing issues
- Use breakpoints and step-through debugging in IDE

## Code Reviews

- Submit pull requests for all changes
- Ensure tests pass before requesting review
- Review code for readability, performance, and security
- Provide constructive feedback

## Commit Messages

- Use conventional commits format:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `style:` for formatting
  - `refactor:` for code changes without feature or bug fix
  - `test:` for adding or updating tests
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

## Pull Requests

- Link related issues in PR description
- Provide clear description of changes
- Include screenshots or logs if applicable
- Request reviews from maintainers

## Continuous Integration

- All PRs trigger CI workflows
- Ensure all checks pass before merging
- Use GitHub Actions for automation

## Useful Tools

- `flutter pub run build_runner build` for code generation
- `flutter analyze` for static analysis
- `flutter format` for code formatting
- `flutter test` for running tests

## Community and Support

- Join the Katya community channels for help and discussion
- Report issues via GitHub Issues
- Contribute via pull requests
