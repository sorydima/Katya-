# Project Architecture

Katya is built using the Flutter framework, enabling multi-platform development with a single codebase.

## Key Components:
- **UI Layer**: Flutter widgets responsible for the presentation layer.
- **State Management**: [Explain if you use any specific state management tool such as Provider, Riverpod, or BLoC].
- **Backend Integration**: Describe how the app communicates with APIs or other services.
- **Platform-Specific Code**: Explanation of any iOS/Android-specific implementations.

## Folder Structure:
- `/lib`: Contains the main Dart code for the application.
- `/test`: Unit and widget tests.
- `/android`, `/ios`, `/web`: Platform-specific configurations.
