## Mentorship Activities

### Code Review Sessions
```dart
// Example: Reviewing a Flutter widget
class ReviewExample extends StatelessWidget {
  // ❌ Bad: No documentation
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(); // What does this do?
  }

  // ✅ Good: Well-documented and clean
  /// A card displaying user information with profile picture and name
  ///
  /// Features:
  /// - Circular profile avatar
  /// - User name and status
  /// - Tap to view full profile
  class UserCard extends StatelessWidget {
    final User user;

    const UserCard({Key? key, required this.user}) : super(key: key);

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Card(
        child: ListTile(
          leading: CircleAvatar(
            backgroundImage: NetworkImage(user.avatarUrl),
          ),
          title: Text(user.name),
          subtitle: Text(user.status),
          onTap: () => Navigator.pushNamed(
            context,
            '/profile',
            arguments: user,
          ),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
}
```

### Architecture Discussions
```dart
// Example: Discussing state management choices
// Provider Pattern (Simple apps)
class CounterProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  int _count = 0;
  int get count => _count;

  void increment() {
    _count++;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

// Bloc Pattern (Complex apps)
class CounterBloc extends Bloc<CounterEvent, CounterState> {
  CounterBloc() : super(CounterInitial()) {
    on<CounterIncremented>((event, emit) {
      emit(CounterUpdated(state.count + 1));
    });
  }
}

// Redux Pattern (Large-scale apps)
class AppState {
  final int counter;
  final User? user;
  final List<Message> messages;

  AppState({
    required this.counter,
    this.user,
    required this.messages,
  });
}
```
