## Estimation Techniques

### Planning Poker
**Process**:
1. Product Owner presents user story
2. Team discusses understanding and asks questions
3. Each team member privately selects estimate card
4. Cards are revealed simultaneously
5. Discuss estimates and reach consensus

**Card Values**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, âˆž, ?

### Story Point Estimation
**Factors Considered**:
- **Complexity**: Technical complexity of implementation
- **Effort**: Amount of work required
- **Uncertainty**: Level of unknowns and risks
- **Dependencies**: Reliance on other tasks or teams

**Story Point Scale**:
- **1 point**: Simple task, clear requirements, minimal complexity
- **2 points**: Straightforward task with some complexity
- **3 points**: Moderate complexity, some uncertainty
- **5 points**: Complex task with multiple components
- **8 points**: High complexity, significant uncertainty
- **13+ points**: Very complex, should be broken down

### Time-Based Estimation
**For Tasks Requiring Specific Time Commitments**:
- **1-2 hours**: Quick fixes, documentation updates
- **2-4 hours**: Small features, bug fixes
- **4-8 hours**: Medium features, integration work
- **8+ hours**: Large features, complex implementations

## Sprint Execution

### Daily Standup
**Format**: 15-minute daily meeting
**Structure**:
1. **What did I accomplish yesterday?**
2. **What will I work on today?**
3. **Are there any impediments?**

**Best Practices**:
- Keep it brief and focused
- Update task board during standup
- Address impediments immediately
- Include remote team members via video

### Sprint Tracking
**Tools Used**:
- **GitHub Projects**: Visual task board
- **Burndown Chart**: Track progress over time
- **Velocity Chart**: Monitor team performance
- **Cumulative Flow**: Visualize work in progress

**Daily Monitoring**:
- Update task status
- Move items between columns
- Identify bottlenecks
- Adjust workload as needed

### Sprint Metrics
- **Burndown**: Remaining work vs. time
- **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint
- **Cycle Time**: Time from start to completion

## Capacity Planning

### Team Capacity Calculation
**Formula**: Available Hours Ã— Focus Factor Ã— Sprint Length

**Factors**:
- **Available Hours**: Total working hours per team member
- **Focus Factor**: Percentage of time available for feature work (typically 60-80%)
- **Sprint Length**: Number of working days in sprint
- **Team Size**: Number of team members

**Example**:
- Team of 5 developers
- 8-hour workdays, 10-day sprint
- 70% focus factor (30% for meetings, support, etc.)
- Capacity = 5 Ã— 8 Ã— 10 Ã— 0.7 = 280 hours

### Velocity Tracking
**Purpose**: Predict future sprint capacity
**Calculation**: Average story points completed over last 3-5 sprints
**Adjustment**: Account for team changes, complexity variations

### Capacity Planning Template
```markdown
