# Accessibility Guidelines

This document outlines the accessibility standards and guidelines for the Katya application, ensuring it is usable by people with disabilities.

## Overview

Accessibility (a11y) is a fundamental aspect of inclusive design. Katya is committed to providing an accessible experience for all users, regardless of their abilities or assistive technologies used.

## Standards Compliance

Katya aims to comply with the following accessibility standards:

- **WCAG 2.1 AA** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
- **Section 508** (US Federal accessibility requirements)
- **EN 301 549** (European accessibility standard)
- **Platform-specific guidelines** (iOS, Android, Web)

## Key Principles

### 1. Perceivable
Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

- **Text Alternatives**: Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- **Time-based Media**: Provide alternatives for time-based media
- **Adaptable**: Create content that can be presented in different ways
- **Distinguishable**: Make it easier for users to see and hear content

### 2. Operable
User interface components and navigation must be operable.

- **Keyboard Accessible**: All functionality available via keyboard
- **Enough Time**: Provide users enough time to read and use content
- **Seizures and Physical Reactions**: Do not design content that causes seizures
- **Navigable**: Provide ways to help users navigate and find content

### 3. Understandable
Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.

- **Readable**: Make text content readable and understandable
- **Predictable**: Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways
- **Input Assistance**: Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust
Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

- **Compatible**: Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents

## Implementation Guidelines
