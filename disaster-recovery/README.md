# Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

This directory contains comprehensive disaster recovery plans, business continuity strategies, and incident response procedures for the Katya project.

## Overview

Disaster recovery (DR) and business continuity planning (BCP) are critical components of Katya's operational resilience. This documentation outlines strategies to minimize downtime, protect data, and ensure rapid recovery from various disaster scenarios.

## Disaster Recovery Strategy

### Recovery Objectives
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable downtime
  - Critical systems: 4 hours
  - Important systems: 24 hours
  - Non-critical systems: 72 hours

- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss
  - Critical data: 15 minutes
  - Important data: 1 hour
  - Non-critical data: 24 hours

### Recovery Strategies
- **Hot Site**: Fully configured standby environment (for critical systems)
- **Warm Site**: Partially configured environment with some hardware/software (for important systems)
- **Cold Site**: Basic infrastructure only, requires full setup (for non-critical systems)
- **Cloud Recovery**: Use cloud infrastructure for rapid recovery
